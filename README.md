# Baking Recipes

Android app that fetches list of baking recipes from using web-services. View list of recipes. Upon selecting a recipe, user gets options to see ingredients, recipe lists and available instruction videos. App is compatible for tablet as well. Integrated third party libraries and provided a complete UX with home screen widget.

List of recipes are fetched from a json file. This repository uses AsyncTask for background processing. TabLayout is used to show 3 different tabs for list of ingredients, recipe steps and video instructions. Videos are being played using ExoPlayer library. This app also provides a user friendly table version for multi-pane devices. This was achieved by using Fragments for code reusability for phone and tablet devices.
